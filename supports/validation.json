  "Objective": "To rigorously validate the TDD simulation framework's adherence to specified robot behaviors (Navigation, Safety, Sensing, Locomotion) within physics-based environments.",
  "Scope": {
    "InScope": [
      "Navigation: Movement in 3D, diagonal, zigzag, and circular paths.",
      "Pick_and_Place: Object manipulation and blocked gripper scenarios.",

  "Challenges": [
    "Ensuring simulation physics models (PyBullet) accurately reflect the Pioneer3DX dynamics.",
    "Maintaining stable and consistent behavior across different simulation engine versions (PyBullet vs. Gazebo).",

  "TestPurposes": [
    "Ensure simulation physics models (PyBullet) accurately reflect the Pioneer3DX dynamics.",
    "Verify the correct implementation of the robot's control logic against Gherkin specifications.",
    "Automate the regression suite for every code commit.",
    "Provide clear traceability from requirements (requirements.csv) to test results (Allure Report)."
  ],
  "FrameworkCapabilities": [
    "Python 3.10+ Behave/Pytest-TDD framework execution.",
    "Dynamic scenario execution using Scenario Outlines and data tables.",
    "Simulation state management (resetting environment and robot position).",
    "Real-time position and velocity validation checks."
  ],
  "Limitations": [
    "Manual tests are required for subjective evaluation (e.g., visual smoothness, physics realism).",
    "Performance tests (e.g., maximum CPU usage, loop timing) are not currently included in the TDD scope.",
    "Requires a running PyBullet or Gazebo instance for execution."
