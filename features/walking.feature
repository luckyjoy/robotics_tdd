Feature: Robot Walking
  Verify walking and crouching behaviors

  @stand
  Scenario Outline: Robot starts walking from different positions
    Given a robot at position [<start_x>, <start_y>, <start_z>]
    When the robot starts walking
    Then the robot should be walking

    Examples:
      | start_x | start_y | start_z |
      | 0       | 0       | 0       |
      | 1       | 0       | 0       |
      | 0       | 1       | 0       |
      | 1       | 1       | 1       |

  @ground
  Scenario Outline: Robot crouches from different positions
    Given a robot at position [<start_x>, <start_y>, <start_z>]
    When the robot crouches so that its chest touches the ground
    Then the robot should be in crouched position

    Examples:
      | start_x | start_y | start_z |
      | 0       | 0       | 0       |
      | 0       | 0       | 1       |
      | 1       | 1       | 1       |

  @walking
  Scenario Outline: Robot walks forward by variable distances
    Given a robot at position [<start_x>, <start_y>, <start_z>]
    When the robot walks forward by <distance> units
    Then the robot should be at position [<end_x>, <end_y>, <end_z>]

    Examples:
      | start_x | start_y | start_z | distance | end_x | end_y | end_z |
      | 0       | 0       | 0       | 1        | 0     | 1     | 0     |
      | 0       | 1       | 0       | 2        | 0     | 3     | 0     |
      | 1       | 0       | 0       | 3        | 1     | 3     | 0     |
      | 2       | 2       | 0       | 1        | 2     | 3     | 0     |
